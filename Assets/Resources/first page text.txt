Intro:
You are a hungover, penniless bunny and not that happy about the whole hungover thing.
Obviously, the world and everyone in it are to blame. Why not show your righteous 
contempt by insulting everyone you see?

How to play:
Your goal is to get to the bartender and destroy their self-worth so they fade away with angst..
thus leaving all the lovely booze unattended. 
Get rid of anyone who dares to stand in your way by constructing mean sentences.
Click on the given phrases in order to form an insult. No take-backs: you can't un-say things. 
When all five slots are full, wait for your opponent's reaction. 
You have to completely ruin their will to live. Use (more or less) proper grammar 
and select your words carefully to do so. It may take a few tries..
